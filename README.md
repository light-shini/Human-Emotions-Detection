# Emotion Detection from Text

This project is a machine learning and deep learning-based solution for detecting emotions from text. The model classifies text into various emotions such as sadness, joy, anger, love, and more.

## Overview

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify emotions in text data. It employs a range of classifiers including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The best-performing model is used for predictions.

## Project Structure

- `train.txt`: The dataset used for training and testing.
- `logistic_regression.pkl`: Trained Logistic Regression model.
- `label_encoder.pkl`: Label encoder for mapping emotions to numerical labels.
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer for text vectorization.
- `emotion_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.15.0
   pip install scikit-learn
   pip install pandas
   pip install numpy
   pip install seaborn
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install wordcloud
   pip install nltk
   ```

## Data

The dataset (`train.txt`) consists of text comments labeled with corresponding emotions. Each row contains a comment and its associated emotion.

## Model Training

The following steps outline the process of training the model:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning the text by removing special characters and stopwords.
   - Encoding the target emotions using label encoding.
   - Vectorizing the text data using TF-IDF.

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Various classifiers were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM.
   - The Logistic Regression model provided the best performance.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The models were evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## Usage

To use the model for emotion prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Load the models and vectorizer:**
   ```python
   import pickle

   lg = pickle.load(open("logistic_regression.pkl", 'rb'))
   lb = pickle.load(open("label_encoder.pkl", 'rb'))
   tfidf_vectorizer = pickle.load(open("tfidf_vectorizer.pkl", 'rb'))
   ```

2. **Predict Emotion:**
   ```python
   def clean_text(text):
       # Add text cleaning logic here
       return cleaned_text

   def predict_emotion(input_text):
       cleaned_text = clean_text(input_text)
       input_vectorized = tfidf_vectorizer.transform([cleaned_text])
       predicted_label = lg.predict(input_vectorized)[0]
       predicted_emotion = lb.inverse_transform([predicted_label])[0]
       return predicted_emotion

   sentence = "Your input text here"
   emotion = predict_emotion(sentence)
   print(f"Predicted Emotion: {emotion}")
   ```

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 83% on the test set. The classification report provides a detailed breakdown of the precision, recall, and f1-score for each emotion class.
